# Factor-Analysis

Factor analysis using PCA, SVD and bottleneck neural network (BNN) autoencoders using the Boston Housing dataset.

The folder ```R``` contains the RStudio script for the implementation and a Rmarkdown file for generating the report. 

The Dockerfile runs a session of RStudio Server to ensure reproducibility of results. See https://github.com/vettorefburana/Run-Rstudio-Server-from-Docker for instructions on how to run the Docker container.
